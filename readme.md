# Welcome!
<b> so... what is this? </b>

these are extensions that you can use in your games that interact with the console of Scratch Next.

<b> how do i use these extensions? </b>

go to https://turbowarp.org/editor?extension=https%3A%2F%2Fcube-enix.github.io%2Fsource%2520code%2FSNextDevTools.js to test it.

<b> how do these things work? </b>

well, there's a bunch of code that gets run at runtime where you put the block, like normal Scratch, except these interact with the ScratchNext console by us.
There is more explaination on these blocks in the documentation.
