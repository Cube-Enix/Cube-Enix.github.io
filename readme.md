<b> so... what is this? </b>

these are extensions that you can use in your games that interact with the console of Scratch Next.

<b> how do i use these extensions? </b>

go to https://turbowarp.org, and add a new extension url. in the url box, type/import https://cube-enix.github.io/source%20code/SNextDevTools.js to test it in its current state.

OR GO TO

https://sheeptester.github.io/scratch-gui/?url= https://cube-enix.github.io/source%20code/SNextDevTools.js to test it in sandbox mode.

<b> how do these things work? </b>

well, there's a bunch of code that gets run at runtime where you put the block, like normal Scratch, except these interact with the ScratchNext console by us.
There is more explaination on these blocks in the documentation.
